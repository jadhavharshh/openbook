# APM Task Assignment: Rich Text Editor Improvements

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent (Agent_Journal) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the OpenBook project.

**Your Role:** As Agent_Journal, you are responsible for enhancing the journal's rich text editing capabilities to improve user experience and content management. This task focuses on optimizing the Tiptap editor integration, adding support for enhanced content blocks, and implementing drag-and-drop functionality.

**Workflow:** You will interact with the Manager Agent via the User, who serves as the communication bridge. After completing your task, you will log your work in the designated Memory Bank file, which serves as the project's official record of progress.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 2, Task 2.1 - Rich Text Editor Improvements` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Enhance the journal's rich text editing capabilities to improve user experience and content management.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Optimize the Tiptap editor integration:**
   - Update Tiptap configuration for better performance and extensibility by examining the current implementation in the journal components.
   - Implement additional extensions for advanced content blocks, ensuring they integrate well with the existing editor.
   - Ensure editor state persistence with local storage to prevent data loss and improve the user experience.
   - Review and optimize the current editor configuration for performance, particularly focusing on render cycles and state management.

2. **Add support for enhanced content blocks:**
   - Implement LaTeX integration for mathematical notation using `katex` or a similar library that works well with Tiptap.
   - Add table support with formatting options (merge cells, styling, etc.) by implementing the Tiptap table extension.
   - Create media embedding functionality for images and external content (e.g., videos, tweets) with proper rendering and responsive behavior.
   - Add code blocks with syntax highlighting using appropriate extensions that support multiple programming languages.
   - Ensure each content block type has appropriate UI controls for creation and editing.

3. **Implement drag-and-drop functionality:**
   - Allow rearranging content blocks within the journal by implementing drag handles and appropriate event handlers.
   - Enable drag-and-drop file uploads for embedding media directly into the journal.
   - Add smooth animations for UI feedback during drag operations using the motion system implemented in Task 1.1.
   - Implement appropriate visual indicators for drag targets and drop zones.
   - Ensure the drag-and-drop functionality works intuitively and follows accessibility best practices.

## 3. Project Context and Resources

### Current Journal Implementation
The OpenBook project already has a basic journal feature with:
- A simple text editor based on Tiptap
- Basic formatting options (bold, italic, lists)
- Journal entry management via a sidebar
- Local storage persistence for entries

### Key Files and Components
- `components/journal/JournalEditor.tsx` - The main editor component
- `app/journal/[id]/page.tsx` - Journal entry page
- `hooks/useJournal.ts` - Hook for journal state management
- `lib/journal/storage.ts` - Journal persistence utilities
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles

### Dependencies and Technologies
- Tiptap editor (`@tiptap/react` and related extensions)
- KaTeX for LaTeX rendering (`katex` and `react-latex-next`)
- Code syntax highlighting libraries (`highlight.js` or similar)
- Framer Motion for animations

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:**
- The journal editor offers a rich set of content block types (text, headings, lists, code, LaTeX, tables, media)
- Content blocks can be rearranged via drag-and-drop
- Files can be uploaded via drag-and-drop
- Editor state is properly persisted to prevent data loss
- All features work smoothly with appropriate visual feedback

**Specific Deliverables:**
1. Enhanced Tiptap editor configuration with optimized performance
2. New content block types (LaTeX, tables, code blocks, media)
3. Drag-and-drop functionality for block rearrangement and file uploads
4. Visual feedback animations during interactions
5. Updated persistence layer to handle new content types

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank file located at:
`Memory/Phase_2_Journal_Enhancement/Task_2.1_Rich_Editor_Log.md`

Adhere strictly to the established logging format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to this assigned task
- A clear description of the actions taken
- Code snippets for key implementations (Tiptap configuration, content block components, drag-and-drop handlers)
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered
- Confirmation of successful execution

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding. In particular, if you need more information about the existing journal implementation or specific requirements for any of the content block types, ask for clarification.
