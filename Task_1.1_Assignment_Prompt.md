# APM Task Assignment: Environment Configuration and Shared Components

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent (Agent_Infrastructure) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the OpenBook project.

**Your Role:** As an Implementation Agent, your responsibility is to execute assigned tasks diligently and log your work meticulously. You will be working on the core infrastructure setup for OpenBook, a learning platform with interconnected note-taking (Journal) and AI chat (Spaces) features.

**Workflow:** You will interact with the Manager Agent via the User, who serves as the communication bridge. After completing your task, you will log your work in the designated Memory Bank file, which serves as the project's official record of progress.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1, Task 1.1 - Environment Configuration and Shared Components` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Set up the development environment and implement shared UI components used across the application.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Review and update project configuration:**
   - Verify Next.js 15.x configuration with App Router by examining the `next.config.js` file to ensure it contains appropriate settings for the App Router architecture.
   - Ensure Tailwind CSS 4 is properly configured with the `@theme` directive by checking the project's CSS files (particularly `app/globals.css`) and confirming the `@import "tailwindcss";` statement is used instead of separate `@tailwind` directives.
   - Set up environment variables for AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic, Groq, XAI) by checking the existing `.env.local` file or creating template variables if needed. Ensure these variables are properly referenced in the relevant API files.

2. **Implement shared motion system components:**
   - Create the animation configuration object as specified in `specs/motion-design.md`. This should be a centralized object that defines standard settings for transitions, spring animations, fade effects, and hover/tap interactions.
   - Implement standard animation patterns for hover interactions, click/tap feedback, and element transitions based on the "Slide & Settle" motion system described in the specs.
   - Add support for reduced motion preferences by implementing a system that respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
   - Create the shared animation configuration in a new file called `lib/motion-config.ts`.

3. **Update core UI components for consistency:**
   - Review and refine the sidebar component architecture to ensure it follows best practices.
   - Implement hover and animation effects following the "Slide & Settle" pattern detailed in `specs/motion-design.md`. 
   - Create shared components for loading states and feedback animations that can be reused across the application.
   - **IMPORTANT:** Do not modify existing sidebar or terminal-chat input styling. Maintain their current visual appearance and behavior while implementing the animation system.

4. **Set up global state management structures:**
   - Configure React Context providers in app layout to ensure consistent state management.
   - Implement hooks for accessing and manipulating global state.
   - Set up local storage persistence for offline-first functionality to ensure data is preserved even when offline.

## 3. Project Context and Resources

### Current Project Structure
The OpenBook project uses:
- Next.js 15.x with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic, Groq, XAI)
- Framer Motion for animations
- Local storage for offline-first persistence

### Key File References
- `app/layout.tsx` - Main application layout
- `app/globals.css` - Global CSS styles
- `components/sidebar.tsx` - Sidebar component
- `components/terminal/terminal-input.tsx` - Terminal-style input component  
- `specs/motion-design.md` - Motion design specifications

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:**
- All configuration files are updated correctly
- The animation system is implemented according to specs
- UI components use the new animation system
- Global state management is properly configured
- All changes maintain existing styling of sidebar and terminal-chat input

**Specific Deliverables:**
1. Updated Tailwind CSS configuration
2. New `lib/motion-config.ts` file with animation configuration
3. Enhanced UI components with animation integration
4. Global context providers properly set up in app layout

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank file located at:
`Memory/Phase_1_Core_Infrastructure/Task_1.1_Environment_Config_Log.md`

Adhere strictly to the established logging format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to this assigned task
- A clear description of the actions taken
- Any code snippets generated or modified
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered
- Confirmation of successful execution

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
