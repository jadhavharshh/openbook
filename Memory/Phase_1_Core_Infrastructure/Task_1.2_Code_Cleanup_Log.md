**Agent:** Agent_Infrastructure
**Date:** 2024-07-13
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task 1.2 - Code Cleanup and Optimization
**Status:** Completed

### Summary

Performed comprehensive code cleanup by removing unused components, files, and dependencies to improve codebase cleanliness and performance. Used the knip tool to identify unused code and systematically removed it.

### Actions Taken

1. **Identified unused code**:
   - Used the `knip` tool to identify unused files, exports, and dependencies
   - Verified findings by checking for references to suspected unused components
   - Created a backup of the terminal-chat directory before removal

2. **Removed unused components**:
   - Deleted 18 unused UI components including:
     - `components/LimitIndicator.tsx`
     - `components/academic-papers.tsx`
     - `components/place-card.tsx`
     - `components/reason-search.tsx`
     - Multiple unused UI components in `components/ui/` directory

3. **Removed unused hooks**:
   - Deleted `hooks/use-media-query.tsx`
   - Deleted `hooks/use-window-size.tsx`

4. **Removed entire unused directories**:
   - Removed the entire `terminal-chat/` directory after creating a backup

5. **Cleaned up package.json**:
   - Removed 32 unused dependencies including:
     - `@foobar404/wave`
     - `@radix-ui/react-accordion`
     - `@tiptap/*` packages
     - `highlight.js`
     - `lowlight`
     - `recharts`
     - And many more
   - Removed 6 unused devDependencies

6. **Removed unused exports**:
   - Removed unused functions from `app/actions.ts`:
     - `generateSpeech`
     - `fetchMetadata`

### Output/Result

The codebase is now significantly cleaner with:
- 93 unused files removed
- 32 unused dependencies removed
- 6 unused devDependencies removed
- 22 unused exports removed
- 5 unused exported types removed

Package size has been reduced, and the project structure is more maintainable with only the necessary components and dependencies remaining.

### Issues/Blockers

No issues or blockers were encountered during the cleanup process.

### Next Steps

- Consider running a performance benchmark to quantify the improvements in load time and bundle size
- Set up automated linting rules to prevent accumulation of unused code in the future
- Update documentation to reflect the current project structure
