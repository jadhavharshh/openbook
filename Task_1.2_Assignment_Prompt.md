# APM Task Assignment: Code Cleanup and Optimization

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are continuing as an Implementation Agent (Agent_Infrastructure) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the OpenBook project.

**Your Role:** Having completed Task 1.1, you will now focus on optimizing the codebase by removing unused components and code to improve cleanliness and performance. This task is critical for maintaining a lightweight, maintainable codebase as the project evolves.

**Workflow:** You will interact with the Manager Agent via the User, who serves as the communication bridge. After completing your task, you will log your work in the designated Memory Bank file, which serves as the project's official record of progress.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1, Task 1.2 - Code Cleanup and Optimization` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Remove unused components and code to improve codebase cleanliness and performance.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Identify and remove unused components:**
   - Analyze the codebase to find components that are no longer referenced in the application.
   - Create a comprehensive list of these components, documenting their original purpose and why they can be safely removed.
   - Remove the unused component files while maintaining the overall project structure integrity.
   - Ensure that removing these components doesn't break any imports or dependencies elsewhere in the codebase.

2. **Eliminate dead code across the application:**
   - Search for and remove unused imports and variables throughout the codebase.
   - Identify and delete commented-out code blocks that are no longer needed for reference.
   - Remove unused utility functions, helpers, and constants that aren't being called.
   - Use tools like ESLint with the `no-unused-vars` rule to help identify unused variables and imports.
   - Look specifically for:
     - Deprecated features or functionality that has been replaced
     - Commented code blocks with "TODO" markers that have been addressed
     - Duplicate utility functions with similar functionality

3. **Optimize existing code:**
   - Refactor repetitive code patterns into reusable components or hooks to improve maintainability.
   - Identify performance bottlenecks, particularly in render cycles, and optimize them.
   - Update dependencies to their latest stable versions where it provides performance or security benefits.
   - Apply best practices such as memoization for expensive computations and proper React hooks dependencies.
   - Look for opportunities to simplify complex functions or components by breaking them down into smaller, more focused pieces.

4. **Document code cleanup actions:**
   - Create detailed documentation of all components and code that have been removed.
   - Update any relevant component references or imports that have changed due to the cleanup.
   - Verify that the application still functions correctly after all changes, with particular attention to features that might have depended on removed code.
   - Prepare a summary of the performance improvements or bundle size reductions achieved.

## 3. Project Context and Resources

### Current Codebase Structure
The OpenBook project's key directories that should be examined include:

- `components/` - UI components including potentially unused ones
- `lib/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `contexts/` - React Context providers
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `terminal-chat/` - Chat-related components (may contain legacy code)
- `trash/` - Possibly already identified unused code that needs proper removal

### Potential Target Areas
- Look for duplicate functionality between newer and older components
- Check for unused state in context providers
- Search for commented-out code blocks marked as temporary
- Identify experimental features that weren't fully implemented
- Review test files that may reference obsolete code paths

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:**
- Unused components and code have been identified and safely removed
- No functionality regressions have been introduced by the cleanup
- The codebase is more maintainable with less clutter
- Application performance has improved where possible
- Comprehensive documentation of changes has been created

**Specific Deliverables:**
1. List of removed components and code with justifications
2. Performance impact assessment (bundle size reduction, render time improvements)
3. Updated imports and references where needed
4. Refactored code for identified repetitive patterns
5. Documentation of cleanup actions in the Memory Bank

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank file located at:
`Memory/Phase_1_Core_Infrastructure/Task_1.2_Code_Cleanup_Log.md`

Adhere strictly to the established logging format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to this assigned task
- A clear description of all code and components removed
- Before/after snippets for significant optimizations
- Any key decisions made about what to keep vs. remove
- Confirmation of successful execution with no functionality regressions

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding. In particular, if you're uncertain whether specific code can be safely removed, ask for clarification rather than risking the removal of essential functionality.
