# Git Hygiene Implementation

Implementation of Git hygiene practices and guard rails to prevent unwanted files from being committed.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Update .gitignore with rules for backup files and TS build cache
- [x] Create dangerfile.js with rule to detect backup artifacts
- [x] Set up Husky for pre-commit hooks
- [x] Configure lint-staged to run linting on staged files
- [x] Install and configure Prettier for code formatting
- [x] Add danger.js for CI checks

## Implementation Plan

The implementation follows the steps outlined in the Git hygiene document:

1. Added entries to .gitignore to prevent backup files and build cache from being committed
2. Created dangerfile.js to detect backup artifacts in CI
3. Set up pre-commit hooks using Husky and lint-staged to run linting before commits
