# Loading States Design

Decision on the design and implementation of loading indicators throughout the application.

## Implementation Approach

The project uses a multi-level approach to loading indicators:

### Message Loading
- Skeleton loading that matches the structure of actual messages
- Dynamic loading text that adapts based on thinking duration
- Progress bars for streaming content with estimated completion

### Visual Design
- Consistent styling between loading states and final content
- Responsive layouts that adapt to mobile screens
- Subtle animations that don't cause layout shifts

### Technical Implementation
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Create dedicated components for each loading state
- Track timing and progress with stateful updates

## Design Guidelines

- All loading indicators use a combination of skeletons, progress bars, and contextual messages
- Loading indicators adapt to duration (shorter for quick operations, more detailed for longer ones)
- Mobile views use simplified layouts with appropriate text truncation
- Maintain consistent styling between loading states and final content
