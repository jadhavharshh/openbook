# P3-Spaces – MVP Chat Spaces

This folder hosts the three incremental tasks that make up **Phase 3** of the implementation plan.

Tasks you will find here:

• **spaces-crud.md** – data layer and persistence for chat spaces.  
• **sidebar-list-ui.md** – a non-styled sidebar list that reuses existing list primitives.  
• **message-skeleton.md** – basic message view with placeholder export logic.

Work through them sequentially or cherry-pick. Each file contains its own acceptance checklist.
