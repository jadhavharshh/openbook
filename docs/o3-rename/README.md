# O3-Rename â€“ Codebase Cleanup & Refactor

Each file in this folder is an **atomic task** that can be handed to a GPT-4.1
coder. Tackle them in sequence or cherry-pick.

| Task                       | File                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Prune dead folders / files | dead-code-removal.md |
| Rename routes & components | route-rename.md      |
| Enforce Git hygiene        | git-hygiene.md       |

The original monolithic plan is now split for clarity.
