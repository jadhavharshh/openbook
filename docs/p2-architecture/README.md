# P2-Architecture – Core Foundations

This folder breaks **Phase 2** of `Implementation_Plan.md` into three self-contained tasks that a smaller GPT-4.1 model can execute one at a time.

Phases and tasks are written as bullet points (no markdown tables) to keep the prompt format LLM-friendly.

Tasks in this folder:

• **shared-types-storage.md** – Create shared domain types and a versioned LocalStorage helper with JSON-schema validation.
• **react-contexts-hooks.md** – Introduce `SpacesProvider` / `NotebookProvider` and their guarding hooks.
• **app-router-skeleton.md** – Scaffold the Next.js App-Router structure and upgrade Tailwind in an add-only manner.

Open a task file, follow the _Implementation Steps_, then verify the _Acceptance Checklist_ at the bottom.
