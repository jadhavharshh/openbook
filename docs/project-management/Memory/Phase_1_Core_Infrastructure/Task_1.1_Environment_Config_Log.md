# Memory Bank Log: Task 1.1 - Environment Configuration and Shared Components

## Task Reference
- **Task ID:** 1.1
- **Task Name:** Environment Configuration and Shared Components
- **Implementation Agent:** Agent_Infrastructure

## Actions Taken

### 1. Project Configuration Review and Updates

#### Verified Next.js 15.x Configuration
- Confirmed that the project is using Next.js 15.x with App Router architecture in `next.config.js`
- The configuration includes appropriate settings for image optimization, page extensions, and other Next.js features

#### Confirmed Tailwind CSS 4 Configuration
- Verified that Tailwind CSS 4 is properly configured with the `@import "tailwindcss";` directive in `app/globals.css` instead of separate `@tailwind` directives
- Confirmed the application is using CSS variables for component themes via the `@theme` directive

#### Environment Variable Setup
- Created a template `.env.local.template` file to document required environment variables for AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic, Groq, XAI)
- The project requires various API keys that are properly referenced in the relevant API files

### 2. Implemented Shared Motion System Components

#### Created Animation Configuration
- Implemented the centralized animation configuration object as specified in `specs/motion-design.md`
- Created the file `lib/motion-config.ts` with standard settings for transitions, spring animations, fade effects, and hover/tap interactions

#### Standard Animation Patterns
- Implemented standard animation patterns for hover interactions (with a small horizontal slide on hover)
- Created click/tap feedback animations (reducing scale slightly when clicked)
- Added consistent element transition animations using fade effects
- Implemented panel expansion animations using spring physics

#### Added Support for Reduced Motion Preferences
- Implemented a system that respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Created the `MotionContext.tsx` provider to manage motion preferences across the application
- Added mechanisms to detect system preferences and allow user overrides
- Implemented local storage persistence for user motion preferences

#### Created Motion Hooks for Component Use
- Developed `useMotion`, `useElementTransition`, and `useHoverAnimation` hooks in `hooks/useMotion.ts`
- These hooks integrate with the motion context to respect user preferences
- They provide consistent animation patterns throughout the application

### 3. Updated Core UI Components

#### Created Shared UI Components
- Implemented a `LoadingIndicator` component that respects reduced motion preferences
- Created a `FeedbackAnimation` component for displaying success, error, warning, and info states
- Both components use the shared animation configuration

#### Updated Sidebar Component
- Refactored the `SidebarNotebook` component to use the new animation system
- Implemented consistent hover and animation effects following the "Slide & Settle" pattern
- Maintained the current visual appearance while enhancing the animation behavior

### 4. Set Up Global State Management

#### Configured Context Providers
- Added `MotionProvider` to the application's provider tree in `app/providers.tsx`
- Implemented state persistence using local storage for motion preferences
- Ensured the motion context provider is high in the component tree to be accessible throughout the app

## Key Decisions

1. **Animation Patterns**: Used the "Slide & Settle" pattern as specified in the design documentation, with consistent hover effects (x: 3) and tap animations (scale: 0.98).

2. **Reduced Motion Support**: Implemented a comprehensive system for respecting user preferences regarding reduced motion by:
   - Checking the system `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
   - Allowing user preferences to override system defaults
   - Persisting these preferences in local storage
   - Creating responsive hooks that adapt animations based on preferences

3. **Component Architecture**: Created dedicated animation hooks to promote reuse and consistency across the application.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Type Safety Issues**: Encountered type safety issues with the animation configuration when supporting reduced motion. Solution: Created a specialized type `ReducedMotionSettings` to handle the different configuration shape needed when animations are minimized.

2. **Context Integration**: Needed to ensure animation preferences were available throughout the application. Solution: Created a dedicated context provider and integrated it high in the component tree.

3. **Component Refactoring**: Updated existing components to use the new animation system while maintaining backward compatibility. Solution: Created abstraction layers through hooks that could be gradually integrated into components.

## Execution Confirmation

All tasks have been successfully completed according to the specified requirements:

- ✅ Environment configuration has been verified and documented
- ✅ Shared motion system has been implemented with reduced motion support
- ✅ Core UI components have been updated with the new animation system
- ✅ Global state management structures have been set up with local storage persistence

The implementation follows the "Slide & Settle" motion design system, providing a cohesive and consistent user experience across the application while respecting user preferences for reduced motion.
