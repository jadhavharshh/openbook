# APM Task Assignment: Add Baseline Development Tooling

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

**Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the OpenBook project.

**Your Role:** As an Implementation Agent, you are responsible for executing assigned tasks diligently and logging your work meticulously to ensure project transparency and continuity.

**Workflow:** You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and must document all significant actions, decisions, and outcomes in the project's Memory Bank system for future reference and project tracking.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 0: Repository Audit Cleanup / Task 0C` as documented in the Memory Bank structure.

**Objective:** Enhance the development environment with essential baseline tooling for code quality, testing, documentation, and development workflow optimization to support the continued development of OpenBook.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Audit Current Development Tooling**

   - Review existing configuration files: `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`, `tsconfig.json`
   - Analyze current package.json scripts and development dependencies
   - Assess current Git hooks setup with husky and lint-staged
   - Evaluate existing code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
   - Check current testing setup and coverage tools

2. **Enhance Code Quality & Linting**

   - Strengthen ESLint configuration with additional rules for Next.js 15 and React best practices
   - Add security-focused ESLint plugins (no-secrets is already present, expand if needed)
   - Configure TypeScript strict mode settings for better type safety
   - Add import/export linting rules for better module organization
   - Set up consistent code formatting rules aligned with project standards

3. **Implement Testing Infrastructure**

   - Add Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
   - Configure test environment for Next.js App Router components
   - Set up test coverage reporting and thresholds
   - Add basic test utilities for mocking contexts (SpacesContext, NotebookContext)
   - Create example tests for critical components (Sidebar, Journal Editor, Message components)
   - Configure testing scripts in package.json

4. **Add Documentation Tooling**

   - Set up JSDoc or TSDoc for inline code documentation
   - Add documentation generation tools for component APIs
   - Configure documentation scripts and workflows
   - Set up automated documentation updates for specifications
   - Add README templates for new components and features

5. **Enhance Build & Development Workflow**

   - Optimize build scripts and add development productivity commands
   - Add bundle analysis tools beyond the existing @next/bundle-analyzer
   - Set up development environment validation scripts
   - Add type-checking scripts separate from build process
   - Configure development server optimizations

6. **Implement Pre-commit & CI/CD Foundations**

   - Enhance existing husky and lint-staged configuration
   - Add pre-commit hooks for running tests and type-checking
   - Set up commit message linting with conventional commits
   - Add branch naming conventions and validation
   - Prepare foundation for CI/CD pipeline configuration

7. **Add Developer Experience Tools**

   - Configure VS Code workspace settings and recommended extensions
   - Add debugging configurations for Next.js development
   - Set up environment variable validation and documentation
   - Add development health check scripts
   - Configure hot reload and fast refresh optimizations

8. **Security & Performance Monitoring**
   - Enhance dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Add performance monitoring tools for development
   - Set up basic security scanning in development workflow
   - Configure logging and error tracking for development environment
   - Add tools for monitoring bundle size and performance regressions

**Execution Notes:**

- Build upon existing tooling rather than replacing working configurations
- Ensure all new tools integrate well with the existing Next.js 15 and pnpm setup
- Test all new tooling with the current codebase before finalizing
- Document any new developer setup requirements

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** Successful completion requires:

- Enhanced development workflow with improved code quality tools
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure ready for component development
- Documentation tooling that supports ongoing development
- Developer experience improvements that increase productivity
- All existing functionality preserved with enhanced tooling support

**Specify Deliverables:**

- Updated configuration files for enhanced linting, formatting, and type-checking
- Complete testing setup with example tests for core components
- Documentation generation tools and templates
- Enhanced package.json scripts for development workflow
- Developer documentation for new tooling and workflows
- VS Code workspace configuration for optimal development experience

**Quality Metrics:**

- All existing code passes enhanced linting rules
- Test coverage baseline established for core components
- Build performance maintained or improved
- Developer setup time documented and optimized
- Code quality metrics improved (TypeScript strictness, linting score)

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

**Instruction:** Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank at `Memory/Phase_0_Repository_Audit_Cleanup/Task_0C_Add_Baseline_Tooling_Log.md`.

**Format Adherence:** Adhere strictly to the established logging format as defined in `agentic-project-m/prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Ensure your log includes:

- A reference to this assigned task: "Task 0C - Add Baseline Tooling"
- Detailed list of tooling additions and configuration changes
- Any new dependencies added and their purposes
- Configuration decisions made and rationale
- Testing setup details and example test implementations
- Developer workflow improvements and documentation
- Performance impact of new tooling on build and development processes
- Instructions for other developers on using the new tooling

**Focus on Developer Experience:** Emphasize improvements to development workflow, code quality, and team productivity.

## 5. Clarification Instruction

**Instruction:** If any part of this task assignment is unclear, or if you need guidance on specific tooling choices or configurations, please state your specific questions before proceeding. Development tooling should enhance productivity without creating unnecessary complexity.
