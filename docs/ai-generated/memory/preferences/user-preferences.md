# User Preferences

User-specific preferences and settings for the application experience.

## Conversation Naming

- **Preserve manual edits**: When a user manually renames a conversation, the system should respect this choice and disable automatic naming
- Provide a clear visual indicator for auto-named vs. manually named conversations
- Allow users to reset to auto-naming if desired

## Mobile Experience

- **Mobile responsiveness**: Loading states are optimized for mobile with simpler layouts and appropriate text truncation
- Touch targets should be adequately sized for mobile interaction
- Reduce animation complexity on mobile devices
- Ensure all core functionality is accessible on smaller screens

## UI Preferences

- Prefer clean, minimalistic interface with reduced visual complexity
- Use subtle visual indicators rather than intrusive notifications
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography throughout the application
- Focus on content readability over decorative elements

## Content Management

- Allow organizing content through pinning and sorting
- Provide clear indicators for active and inactive items
- Enable quick navigation between related content
- Support search and filtering across all content types
