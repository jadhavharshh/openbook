## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract Shared Tools Infrastructure

Create the shared tools infrastructure that will be used across both current and future API structure.

#### 1.1 Create Shared Library Structure
```
app/api/lib/                     # SHARED across all endpoints
├── ai/                          # AI-related shared code
│   ├── providers.ts             # AI model configurations
│   ├── tools/                   # Shared tools (used by chat + study)
│   │   ├── index.ts            # Tool registry
│   │   ├── academic-search.ts   # Academic search tool
│   │   ├── reason-search.ts     # Reason search tool
│   │   └── tool-repair.ts       # Tool repair system
│   └── types.ts                 # AI/tool types
├── services/                    # External service clients
│   ├── exa.ts                  # Academic search service
│   └── tavily.ts               # Web search service
└── study-prompts.ts            # Study framework prompts
```

#### 1.2 Extract Type Definitions
- Create `app/api/lib/ai/types.ts` with all search and research types
- Move interfaces: `XResult`, `ExaResult`, `ResearchPlan`, etc.

#### 1.3 Extract External Services
- Create `app/api/lib/services/exa.ts` for academic search
- Create `app/api/lib/services/tavily.ts` for web search
- Encapsulate API clients with clean interfaces

#### 1.4 Extract AI Providers
- Create `app/api/lib/ai/providers.ts` with neuman provider setup
- Extract provider configurations and model options

### Phase 2: Implement Future API Structure Foundation

Based on `specs/future/api-naming-approach.md`, prepare the foundation for the future structure.

#### 2.1 Create Future API Directories
```
app/api/
├── ai/                    # All AI-powered features (future home)
│   └── .gitkeep          # Placeholder for future migration
├── media/                 # File handling & processing (DONE)
│   ├── upload/           # ✅ Already implemented
│   ├── clean/            # ✅ Already implemented
│   └── proxy/            # ✅ Already implemented
├── integrations/          # External service integrations (future)
│   └── .gitkeep          # Placeholder
└── study/                 # Traditional study tools (current AI study tools)
    ├── extreme-mode/     # ✅ Current AI study features
    ├── feynman-technique/ # ✅ Current AI study features
    ├── memory-palace/    # ✅ Current AI study features
    └── spaced-repetition/ # ✅ Current AI study features
```

#### 2.2 Maintain Current Structure
- Keep `/api/chat` as main AI endpoint for now
- Keep `/api/study/*` as AI study endpoints for now
- Plan for future migration to `/api/ai/chat` and `/api/ai/study/*`

### Phase 3: Refactor Chat Endpoint with Shared Tools

#### 3.1 Extract Tools from Monolithic Route
- Extract `academic_search` tool to `app/api/lib/ai/tools/academic-search.ts`
- Extract `reason_search` tool to `app/api/lib/ai/tools/reason-search.ts`
- Extract tool repair logic to `app/api/lib/ai/tools/tool-repair.ts`
- Create tool registry in `app/api/lib/ai/tools/index.ts`

#### 3.2 Simplify Main Chat Route
- Reduce `app/api/chat/route.ts` from 1079 lines to ~200 lines
- Focus on HTTP handling and orchestration
- Use extracted shared components

#### 3.3 Update Study Endpoints
- Modify study endpoints to use shared tools if needed
- Ensure study endpoints continue to work with refactored chat endpoint

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

#### 4.1 Comprehensive Testing
- Test all study endpoints: `/api/study/*`
- Test main chat endpoint: `/api/chat`
- Verify tool functionality in both contexts
- Test tool repair system
- Test all AI providers and models

#### 4.2 Build Verification
- Ensure clean build after refactoring
- Verify no breaking changes
- Test API endpoint discovery
- Validate response formats

```

## Implementation Benefits

### Immediate Benefits (After Phase 1-3)
1. **Maintainability**: 1079-line monolith broken into manageable pieces
2. **Reusability**: Tools shared between chat and study endpoints
3. **Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested
4. **Debugging**: Easier to isolate and fix issues
5. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns

### Future Benefits (Enables Future Phases)
1. **Scalability**: Foundation for `/api/ai/*` structure
2. **Feature Addition**: Easy to add new AI features under `/api/ai/`
3. **Integration Ready**: Structure for external service integrations
4. **Study Tools**: Clear separation between AI and traditional study tools
5. **Team Collaboration**: Clear ownership boundaries

## Migration Strategy

### Safe Migration Approach
1. **Extract shared components alongside existing code**
2. **Verify functionality with comprehensive testing**
3. **Update main route to use shared components**
4. **Remove old code only after verification**
5. **Maintain backward compatibility throughout**

### Future Migration Path (Post-Implementation)
- Move `/api/chat` → `/api/ai/chat` (with redirect)
- Move `/api/study/*` → `/api/ai/study/*` (when adding traditional study tools)
- Add traditional study tools under `/api/study/*`
- Add integrations under `/api/integrations/*`
