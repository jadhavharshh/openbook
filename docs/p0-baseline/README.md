# P0-Baseline – Repository Hygiene & Tooling

Remaining Phase 0 tasks (0B & 0C) have been broken down here so smaller models can execute them independently of Phase 0A (which already lives in `docs/o3-clean`).

• **purge-dead-code.md** – remove unused code and assets.  
• **baseline-tooling.md** – add ESLint, Prettier, lint-staged and custom style-guard.
