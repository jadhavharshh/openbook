# OpenBook Specifications

This directory contains detailed specification documents for OpenBook features, components, and architectural decisions. These specifications serve as the blueprint for implementation and ensure alignment on vision, requirements, and technical approach.

## Purpose

The specs directory provides a centralized location for:

- Planning new features before implementation
- Documenting architectural decisions
- Defining component requirements and behaviors
- Establishing design patterns and guidelines
- Tracking implementation progress
- Providing reference for future development

## Specification Types

We maintain three types of specification documents:

### Feature Specifications
Detailed plans for implementing user-facing features:
- `*-feature.md` - e.g., `chat-interface-feature.md`, `journal-feature.md`

### Component Specifications
Technical specifications for reusable UI components:
- `*-component.md` - e.g., `rich-editor-component.md`  

### Architecture Specifications
System-level design decisions and patterns:
- `*-architecture.md` - e.g., `app-architecture.md`, `data-persistence-architecture.md`

## Specification Structure

Each specification document follows this general structure:

```markdown
# Feature/Component/Architecture Name

## Overview
Brief description of the feature and its purpose within OpenBook.

## Goals
- Primary objectives of the feature
- Problems it aims to solve
- Success criteria and metrics

## User Experience/Technical Details
- User flows and interactions (for features)
- Technical architecture (for components/architecture)
- Design considerations

## Technical Specifications
- Architecture and implementation approach
- Data models and state management
- API endpoints and interactions
- Dependencies and third-party integrations

## Implementation Plan
- Break down of tasks by priority/phase
- Estimated timeline
- Resource requirements

## Relevant Files
- Key files that will be created or modified
- Components that will need to be developed

## Integration Points
- How this feature/component integrates with other parts of the system

## Open Questions
Items that require further discussion or decisions.

## References
Links to relevant research, similar implementations, or design inspiration.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Create a new specification document** before starting implementation of any significant feature.
2. **Follow the template structure** to ensure comprehensive planning.
3. **Add task lists** to track implementation progress.
4. **Update specifications** as implementation progresses and requirements evolve.
5. **Reference specifications** in related pull requests, issues, and documentation.

## Naming Conventions

- `feature-name-feature.md` for feature specifications (e.g., `chat-interface-feature.md`)
- `component-name-component.md` for component specifications (e.g., `rich-editor-component.md`)
- `topic-architecture.md` for architectural decisions (e.g., `data-persistence-architecture.md`)
