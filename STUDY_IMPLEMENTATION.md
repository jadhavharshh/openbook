# Study Methods Command System - Implementation Complete! üéâ

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive study methods system that extends the `/` command interface to include 4 study frameworks with space-specific persistence and AI integration.

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Extended `lib/types.ts` with StudyFramework enum and StudyModeSettings interface
- [x] Extended Space type in `contexts/SpacesContext.tsx` to include study mode metadata  
- [x] Created `contexts/StudyModeContext.tsx` for managing study mode state per space
- [x] Created `lib/study-prompts.ts` with framework-specific system prompts and utilities
- [x] Integrated StudyModeProvider into app providers hierarchy

### Phase 2: Framework Selection Interface  
- [x] Created `components/study/framework-selector.tsx` with grid layout and keyboard navigation
- [x] Created `components/study/study-mode-badge.tsx` for visual framework indicator
- [x] Extended terminal input commands to include study framework commands
- [x] Integrated FrameworkSelector with terminal input interface

### Phase 3: API Endpoints and System Prompts
- [x] Created `app/api/study/memory-palace/route.ts` endpoint
- [x] Created `app/api/study/feynman-technique/route.ts` endpoint  
- [x] Created `app/api/study/spaced-repetition/route.ts` endpoint
- [x] Created `app/api/study/extreme-mode/route.ts` endpoint
- [x] All endpoints forward to main chat API with framework-specific system prompts

### Phase 4: UI Integration and Visual Indicators
- [x] Integrated study mode context with ChatClient
- [x] Added study mode badge to navbar
- [x] Connected framework selection to API endpoint routing
- [x] Added framework selection handlers and state management

## üéØ How to Use

### Available Commands
- `/frameworks` - Opens framework selector with 4 study methods
- `/extreme` - Quick access to extreme study mode  
- `/tools` - Study tools (placeholder - coming soon)
- `/rules` - Study rules (placeholder - coming soon)

### Study Frameworks
1. **Memory Palace** üèõÔ∏è - Ancient Greek/Roman spatial memory technique
2. **Feynman Technique** üéì - Learn by teaching in simple terms
3. **Spaced Repetition** üìÖ - Review at increasing intervals  
4. **Extreme Mode** ‚ö° - Intensive combination of all frameworks

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Press `1-4` to select frameworks directly
- `Enter` to confirm selection
- `Esc` to cancel
- Arrow keys for navigation

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Context Management
- `StudyModeContext` manages per-space study modes with localStorage persistence
- Space-specific study mode settings that persist across sessions
- Event-driven communication between contexts

### API Routing  
- Dynamic endpoint selection based on active framework
- Framework-specific system prompts modify AI behavior
- Seamless fallback to standard chat API when no study mode is active

### UI Integration
- Study mode badge appears in navbar when framework is active
- Framework selector integrated into terminal command system
- Consistent styling with existing OpenBook design patterns

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `lib/study-prompts.ts` - Framework prompts and utilities
- `contexts/StudyModeContext.tsx` - Study mode state management
- `components/study/framework-selector.tsx` - Framework selection UI
- `components/study/study-mode-badge.tsx` - Visual framework indicator
- `app/api/study/memory-palace/route.ts` - Memory Palace API
- `app/api/study/feynman-technique/route.ts` - Feynman Technique API
- `app/api/study/spaced-repetition/route.ts` - Spaced Repetition API
- `app/api/study/extreme-mode/route.ts` - Extreme Mode API

### Modified Files
- `lib/types.ts` - Added study framework types
- `contexts/SpacesContext.tsx` - Extended Space type with study mode
- `components/terminal/terminal-input.tsx` - Extended command system
- `app/ChatClient.tsx` - Integrated study mode functionality
- `app/providers.tsx` - Added StudyModeProvider

## üöÄ Ready for Testing

The implementation is complete and ready for testing! Users can now:

1. Type `/frameworks` to see the study method selector
2. Use keyboard shortcuts (1-4) to quickly select frameworks
3. See the active study mode badge in the navbar
4. Experience AI responses tailored to their chosen study method
5. Have study modes persist per conversation space

The system is fully functional and follows the comprehensive plan outlined in `docs/command.md`.
